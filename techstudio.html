                    I came into Tech Studio Academy with practically no prior knowledge in software development. 
                    However, within a few weeks, I was able to grasp the crux of software development and also master 
                    the soft skills required for being a software developer.
                    <br><br>
                    So far so good, the skills acquired have given me a mind-blowing push in my career as a software developer.

                    I had an immense learning that was really different from the self learning I started with. 
                    The learning was fun and there were some internship job opportunities that were presented to us. 
                    I got my first gig immediately after the program.
